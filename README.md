# [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) on [Repl.it](https://replit.com/)

This is a template to get you started with
[Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) on
[Repl.it](https://replit.com/).  It's ready to go so you can just hit
run and start coding!

This template was generated using `rails new` (after you install the `rails` gem from the packager sidebar) so you can always do that if you prefer to set it up from scratch.  The only config changes we had to make to run on [Repl.it](https://replit.com/):

- bind the app on `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost` (see `.replit`)
- allow all hosts (see `config/environments/development.rb`)
- allow the app to be iframed (see `config/application.rb`)

This should already be completed in this template.

## Running the App

Simply hit run!  You can edit the run command from the `.replit` file.

## Running Commands

Start every command with `bundle exec` so that it runs in the context
of the installed gems environment.  The console pane will give you
output from the server but you can run arbitrary command from the
shell without stopping the server.

## Database

[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) should work in development but we
don't recommend running it in production.  Instead, look into using
the built-in [Repl.it database](http://docs.repl.it/misc/database).
Otherwise, you are welcome to connect databases from your favorite
provider.
